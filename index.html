                                <p>Durity uses end-to-end encryption to guarantee the security of your files in the
                                    cloud.
                                    Using this technology, Durity encrypts every file and relevant file metadata on your
                                    devices with unique, encryption key. These keys are never sent to our servers in an

                                    user passwords in unencrypted or unhashed form. Due to the strength of Durity’s
                                    end-to-end encryption and security, breaking this protection would take several
                                    human lifetimes. This is why we can never recover forgotten passwords.</p>

                                <p>We use an industry standard high security protocol AES 256 to encrypt all of your
                                    information at the device level before it is stored online. Moreover, we have
                                    several levels of additional security around your data. Hence it is not possible for
                                    anyone to look at your data and impossible to read it since it is encrypted.</p>

                                <p>Your vault is completely private. Due to the secure encryption methods used to store
                                    your information at Durity, no one can see what you've uploaded, not even anyone at
                                    Durity.life. The only people that will ever see the contents of your Vault are you
                                    and your designated trustees only when they request access after any emergency.</p>

                                <p>We use state-of-the-art digital encryption and security technologies to protect your
                                    privacy and security. All data passing from your computer to this web site is
                                    authenticated and encrypted using 256-bit "SSL encryption". This is the most
                                    advanced level of encryption available today, and it means that any information sent
                                    from your computer is scrambled in a way which makes it completely unintelligible if
                                    intercepted. To give you a feeling for the level of security provided by this
                                    encryption, it has been estimated that with the most efficient algorithms known to
                                    date, it would take a computer operating at 1 million instructions per second over
                                    300 quintillion years (that's 3 with 20 zeros behind it!) to break the encryption.
                                    That's several trillion times longer than the age of the Earth.</p>

                                <p> Dropbox and Google Drive are simply document repositories. You cannot assign access

                                    have no clear tracking to know when somebody has accessed, or attempted to access,
                                    your Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
