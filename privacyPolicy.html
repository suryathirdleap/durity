                    Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as their name and
                    email address). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user
                    information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, but only if the
                    user has requested to receive such information. If permitted by you, Durity may use this personal
                    information to contact you, your vault or your trustees for various reasons relating to the services
                    offered through the site. For example, you may receive a notice from Durity to update your vault. In
                    addition, we may wish to inform you about new features we have added to the web site, or we may wish
                    to find out more about how useful you find particular features or services. Users may opt-in or

                    Your member registration and contact information (such as your name and email address) is stored in

                    Once you have established an account with Durity and have chosen to create some messages to be
                    delivered in the future via email, you have the option of notifying your email recipients that they
                    have been selected to receive an email message from you (with or without revealing your name) and
                    that they should notify Durity if their email address changes. All of this activity is under your
                    control, based on the options and preferences you have selected for this particular service.

                    We use industry standard encryption algorithms for storing all of this sensitive personal
                    information in a highly encrypted format on our server, and the design of Durity ensures that this
                    sensitive information is only made available to the specific people designated by yourself, and only
                    at the appropriate time. More information regarding the security of this sensitive information is
                    described below, in the Security section.

                    This site uses state-of-the-art digital encryption and security technologies to protect the privacy
                    and security of our member information and has specific security measures in place to protect the
                    loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All data passing from your computer to Durity is authenticated and encrypted using 256-bit Secure
                    Socket Layer (SSL) encryption using technologies provided by Big rock, the world's largest SSL
                    certificate provider focused solely on security. This is the most advanced level of encryption
                    available today, and it means that any information sent from your computer is scrambled in a way
                    which makes it completely unintelligible if intercepted. This is your assurance that the encryption
                    is in place and that you are communicating across a secure link.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, all sensitive personal information is stored in a highly encrypted format on our
                    server. We use an industry standard high security streaming-encryption algorithm known as "AES" to
                    encrypt all sensitive personal information before it is stored online. AES is a public-key
                    cryptosystem developed by MIT professors (To give you a feeling for the level of security provided
                    by this encryption, it has been estimated that with the most efficient algorithms known to date, it
                    would take a computer operating at 1 million instructions per second over 300 quintillion years to
                    break the encryption.) Also, the encryption method used ensures that the only way possible to access
                    and view the sensitive personal information stored here by a Durity member is by using a private
                    internal encryption key which is unique for every member. Our software algorithms ensure that the
                    encryption and decryption of a member's sensitive personal information can only be performed by the
                    member themselves, or by those designates to which the member has provided a separate unique key
                    known as a "encryption password". It is not even possible for the operators of this web site to
                    decrypt a member's sensitive personal information without knowledge of this encryption key.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As an additional security measure, all successful and unsuccessful attempts to login to a member's
                    account are logged in our database along with date/time stamps, IP addresses, and other detectable
                    information from the user. This information will be used for law enforcement purposes and for the
                    protection of our members should there be any suspicion of unauthorized access to our database.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, we offer members the option of receiving an email alert message whenever their
                    sensitive personal information is accessed, or attempted to be accessed, using a valid key. If
                    unauthorized access is suspected, clicking a link within the email will immediately disable access
                    to the member's sensitive personal information for that key, until the member re-enables the access
                    themselves, or until we are contacted by the member and provided with specific information
                    validating their identity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To protect against catastrophic data loss, daily backups are performed on each of our servers.
                    Hence, if any one of our servers experienced technical difficulties, our member data would not be at
                    risk.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most important security element of any service is the team that runs it. We do not use any
                    temporary staff, nor do we use any offshore or outsourced staff. All of our services were developed
                    locally, and no contract staff were used in the coding of our site. Furthermore, every member of our
                    support team is a full time employee and has been with the company for over five years. We all love
                    working here and are here to help you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you can tell by reading the above, we take the security and privacy of all of our member
                    information very seriously.

                    store or retrieve any information from your hard drive. Durity only uses per-session cookies. These
                    per-session cookies are temporary, reside only in memory (not on your hard drive), and are destroyed
                    when you leave the site or if you remain inactive for 30 minutes. By avoiding the use of cookies
                    which store information on your computer's hard drive, Durity is ensuring that any information about
